# City-SImilarity-Test
Now the CEO has hired a data scientist and assigned him a task to find out the similarity between 
different big cities in the world and group the cities into various clusters, so that the Board of 
Directors can make a better decision of which business mode to operate in new cities. (For 
Example: If London has been grouped into the same cluster with Delhi, the business mode 
operated in Delhi market will be considered for London). The similarity test should be based on 
various factors, including but not limiting to geolocations, economic development, cultures, and 
population components and so on. In order to carry out the task, the data scientist should make a 
full use of FourSquare API and collect a dataset for at least 15 cities, including those in the United 
States and those in other countries.
